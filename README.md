Github tutorial

Hello world,

I am a Gen Y Korean-Canadian living in Toronto.
I've always loved playing games, like Pokemon, Nintendo, and Mario, and liked playing and experimenting around with devices, like computers.

In hindsight, I might have fared better and might have been happier had I chosen to go into graphic design, HCI, or computer science undergrad.

But I chose life science, because not many people knew about computer science back then, because I was bad at English and Arts (by bad, I mean anything below grade A), and ultimately because my parents wanted me to become a doctor.

I did not get into med school, and with that, my existential crisis began.

However, I am extremely fortunate to have wealthy parents who provide me with housing and pretty much everything, so I carry on my days with very little to no worries on budget, and enjoying great desserts and snacks. I am a foodie, so I love over-priced, great looking, and Instagrammable desserts, like bubble tea, matcha pastries, and cheesecake type of sweets. I am not that much into shopping.
Also, I am very fortuante to have a job as well.

Although my depression and bitterness from med school rejection is getting better with time, it has not completey resolved my existential crisis yet.

So with the grand start of the year 2020, and being motivated from all the hope and hype of being a new decade (however, as of April 2020, it's just been a sad year with coronavirus), I enrolled in a new program to study data science!

And that program leads me here, to Github, because the instructor asked the class to submit Assignment 2 in Github. I must say, I procrastinated so much on this assignment, and I feel very ashamed...
